Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
What is trival programs?
Trivial programes are simple programs.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A
What is function declaration?
A declaration is a language construct that specifies properties of an identifier: it declares what a word (identifier) "means".  
What is function parameter?
The term parameter is used to reffer to the variable found in the function.
For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
What is strcat()?
It is a function which allows one memory block to be added at the end of second memory block.
What is a string?
  It is a sequence of charecters either as constants or variable.Later it can be changed or mutated.
What is concatenate?
  It is the operation of joining two strings.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
What is sub routine?
  It is the sequence of program instruction which performs a specific task.
The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.
what is signature function?
  A parameter is like a placeholder.
  What is a placeholder?
  It defines the input and output of the function.
  Given below is the source code for a function called max().
    What is source code?
    Source code is the set of instructions and statements written by a programmer using a computer programming language.
    If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments
    What is an argument?
    Arguments are the values supplied to the procedure when it is called.
    What is procedure in c?
    Small sections of code used to perform specific task.
    These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.
    What is formal parameter?
    It is used to define the variable used in function.
    This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function.
